/**
 * VerifyRowReact.js
 * This component passes down some styling information for popups and default text, and then passes it down to the
 * AccordionVerifier component which deals with most of the actual logic of the Redux Verification Row. 
 * 
 * Note that the name "AccordionVerifier" is a description of a component that shows the tightly coupled nature of the component to its actual usage in the application. 
 * ie. the lack of generality of it. This is not yet reflected in the names of the other accordion components, but they will likely change to match this naming convention.
